 Change History:
  Rev   Description
  ----  -----------------------------------------
  1.02      Initial release
  1.02.2    Modified to support WaitMicroSec & WaitMilliSec functions.
            The way the UART baud rate is set, is changed( function : SCdrv_SetBRG()).
            Removed extern declarations of "factorD" & "factorF" variables.
