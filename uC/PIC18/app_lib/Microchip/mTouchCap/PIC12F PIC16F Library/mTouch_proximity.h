 *  Description:     mTouch Framework Proximity Sensor Include File
 *                   - No application code should be implemented in this
 *                     or any other mTouch framework file. This will allow
 *                     for better customer support and easier upgrades to
 *                     later firmware versions. Use the main.c and user-
 *                     generated files to implement your application.
 *                   - See the documentation located in the docs/ folder
 *                     for a more information about how the framework is
 *                     implemented.
