* @section Intro Introduction
* Thank you for downloading the mTouch Framework v2.1, part of the mTouch Library v1.40.02 package in the MLA.
*
* The mTouch Framework is a software package enabling designers to easily integrate touch technologies
* to their application. It combines high sensitivity with conducted and radiated noise immunity.
*
* Simple configuration file allows for easy setup. Microchip also offers full source code access for more
* advanced touch designers.

/**
* @page Changelog Version Change Log
*
* @section cl0201 Version 2.1
* @li   Enabling a non-TMR0 timer will now also automatically enable the PEIE bit for automatic interrupt use (mTouch.c)
* @li   Default one-way communications now supports the updated Profilab GUI supplied with this framework package (mComm_config.h / mComm.c)
* @li   Configuration values can now be stored in RAM (mTouch_configOptions) instead of EEPROM for use in the two-way communications. See MTOUCH_EEPROM_STORED_AS_RAM in mTouch_config.h
* @li   Individual the oversampling array initialization has been changed to automatically adjust its size based on MTOUCH_NUMBER_SENSORS (mTouch_acquistion.c)
* @li   When mTouch controls the ISR, it will now correctly exit from the function if the mTouch timer was not responsible for the interrupt (mTouch_acquistion.c)
* @li   Fixed an issue with the DAC configuration in the hardware profiles of the 182x and 184x families
* @li   Fixed a bug with the initial EEPROM byte check - previously the EEPROM would revert to factory settings on reset. (mTouch_eeprom.c)
* @li   Fixed the mTouch_ClearToggle(i) API macro: Logical 'not' (<b>!</b>) changed to bit-wise 'not' (<b>~</b>).
*
* @section cl0200 Version 2.0
* @li   Added support for a large number of processors. Refer to this documentations '@ref PICSupport "Resource Requirements"' 
*       page for a full listing.
* @li   The acquisition module has been reworked for added efficiency. 
*   <ul>
*   <li>The assembly-coded jump table has been replaced with a compiler-generated look-up table.
*   <li>The 'scan a' and 'scan b' portions of each sensor's mTouch waveform are dedicated functions that are dynamically 
*       generated at compile-time by the preprocessor macros. This eliminates the previous limitation on the number of sensors 
*       due to the rising length of the single mTouch acquisition function.
*   <li>Individual oversampling values can be enabled from the mTouch_config_cvdAdvanced.h file.
*   </ul>
* @li   Structures have been implemented for a large number of mTouch variables to maximize the efficiency of RAM resources. 
*       Several previously supported processors are now able to implement more sensors due to this change.
* @li   New features:
*   <ul>
*   <li>@ref featMode "Scanning modes" allow different sensor configurations to be scanned based on the application's state.
*   <li>Built-in @ref featProximity "proximity sensor" support with median filter. (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>@ref featSliders "Sliders and wheels" can be implemented by editing the mTouch_config_slider.h options. Supports up 
*       to 10 sliders with 8 sensors per slider.
*   <li>A @ref featMostPressed "most-pressed algorithm" can be implemented by uncommenting #MTOUCH_MOST_PRESSED_ONLY. 
*       (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>Toggle mode is now available by uncommenting #MTOUCH_TOGGLE_ENABLED. (mTouch_config.h) It will toggle the output's 
*       value only when it detects a new press - not when it sees a release. Example API available in main.c. 
*   <li>@ref featGuard "Guard rings/shields" can be implemented using any general IO pin or through the DACOUT pin. 
*       (mTouch_config_cvdAdvanced.h)
*   <li>Support for @ref featMatrix "matrix configurations" can be implemented to automatically decode the rows and columns 
*       with debouncing and a dedicated most-pressed algorithm to ensure quality coordinate results. (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>@ref featMutual "Mutual coupling drives" can be implemented to detect increased coupling between two interconnected 
*       sensors. (mTouch_config_cvdAdvanced.h)
*   <li>mComm communications module added. See mComm_config.h
*       <ul>
*       <li>Implements I2C, SPI, and UART two-way communications to allow changing of configuration values at run-time. 
*       <li>Configuration options and thresholds are stored in EEPROM when this is implemented by defining 
*           #MTOUCH_EEPROM_ENABLED in mTouch_config.h
*       <li>Implements 1-way UART communications in hardware or by using a software-implementation.
*       </ul>
*   </ul>
* @li New configuration options:
*   <ul>
*   <li>#MTOUCH_INTEGRATION_TYPE adjusts the way the framework integrates with the application (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#MTOUCH_ISR_TIMER changes which 8-bit timer is used for the mTouch interrupt (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#MTOUCH_SCAN_FUNCTIONALITY alternates between scanning one sensor per interrupt or scanning all sensors once per 
*       interrupt (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#MTOUCH_ADC_CONTROL determines whether the framework releases the ADC after performing its scan (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#APFCON_INITIALIZED can be used to disable "make sure you initialize" warnings on parts with APFCON registers (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#MTOUCH_DECIMATION_MAX_STEP adjusts the maximum step size for sensors while going through the decimation filter 
*       (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#MTOUCH_JITTER_BITS adjusts the number of bits used to implement the random seed value for jittering (mTouch_config.h)
*   <li>#CVD_FORCE_REF_DAC can be defined to force the CVD acquisition to use the DAC as the reference for the ADC's hold 
*       capacitor (mTouch_config_cvdAdvanced.h)
*   </ul>
* @li Configuration option #CVD_JITTER_ENABLE has been removed. To disable jittering, set the #MTOUCH_JITTER_BITS value to 0.
* @li #MTOUCH_SCALING has been adjusted to allow a larger number of scaling options. (mTouch_config.h)
*
* @section cl0101 Version 1.1
* @li   Non-enhanced Core Device Support
* @li   HI-TECH 9.81 Lite and Standard Compiler Support
* @li   Acquisition variable array #sensor_data is now initialized to 0x47F to reduce the required initialization time
* @li   New configuration option #CVD_SETTLING_DELAY adjusts the amount of time the CVD acquisition will wait for the voltages on 
*       the external sensor and internal ADC hold capacitor to settle. See @ref ts-Waveform "this guide" for more information.
* @li   New configuration option #CVD_CHOLD_CHARGE_DELAY adjusts the amount of time the CVD acquisition will wait for the voltage 
*       on the internal ADC hold capacitor to reach steady state (V<sub>DD</sub> or V<sub>SS</sub>) before connecting the two capacitors and allowing 
*       their voltages to settle. See @ref ts-Waveform "this guide" for more information.
* @li   The scan order of the CVD acquisition has been reversed to ensure maximum sensitivity for larger external sensor 
*       capacitances. This means the waveform will change when viewed on a scope. See @ref ts-Waveform "this guide" for more 
*       information.
* @li   #GENERATE_STORAGE_FUNCTION() and #GENERATE_JUMP_TABLE() macros have been redesigned with a more elegant implementation.
* @li   The mTouch.h file has been split-in-two in order to accomodate the Microchip Application Libraries' directory structure. 
*       A local copy of mTouch.h should be included in your application's includes directory. mTouch_processConfiguration.h, the 
*       other half of the original mTouch.h file, only needs to be available in the library folders and does not require a local 
*       copy.
* @li   Sensor 0's reference is now defined in the process configuration header file to help de-clutter the acquisition.c file.
* @li   Many documentation updates including:
*   <ul>
*   <li> New 'Optimizing Performance' sections designed to make it easier to solve common problems:

* If a non-PRO license is used to compile the framework, the maximum number of supported sensors will decrease. Noise 
* testing was performed using the PRO license.<br>
* Using a third-party compiler may result in unknown behavior due to the heavy use of compile-time code formatting.<br>
*
* @section rrModules Module Requirements
* @li <b>8-bit Hardware Timer Module for Interrupt</b><br>
* This module is used to schedule regular ADC scans on the sensors. 8-bit timers normally interrupt after 256 counts; however, the mTouch
* framework pre-loads the timer's register with a pseudo-random seed value to slightly jitter the sampling rate. This means that the
* average number of counts before it interrupts is 224.<br>
* You control the timer's prescaler and period registers.<br>
* NOTE: No timer is required if #MTOUCH_INTEGRATION_TYPE is defined as MTOUCH_CALLED_FROM_MAINLOOP.
*
* @li <b>Analog/Digital Converter</b><br>
* The ADC is the core module used by the mTouch framework to acquire a sensor reading. If you wish to perform an ADC reading in 
* between mTouch scans you will need to set the #MTOUCH_ADC_CONTROL configuration option to MTOUCH_RELEASES_ADC_AFTER_SCAN.
* The ADC is initialized for the framework by the mTouch_Init() function.<br>
*
* @section rrMemory Memory/Processing Requirements
* Roughly, the amount of time that will be spent in the mTouch ISR is based on the TMR0 prescaler value.

/**
* @page featSliders Sliders and Wheels
*
* The mTouch Framework has a special decoding module for sliders and wheels. It can support up to 10 sliders and 
* up to 8 sensors per slider. The sensors used for the slider/wheel are configured as normal touch sensors. They 
* will be scanned as a normal sensor and then, later, decoded as part of the slider.
*
* @section featSlider-How How It Works
* The slider/wheel decoding module is built on top of the normal decoding. It uses the delta readings of the 
* most-pressed sensor and it's most-pressed neighbor to calculate the touched position. An example is shown below:
* @image html sliderInterpolation.jpg "Slider Position Interpolation"
* The interpolated position is calculated as follows:
* @f[ Interpolated Press Position = (256 \cdot n) \pm \frac{Delta_{n}}{Delta_{n} + Delta_{n \pm 1}} @f]
*
* If #MTOUCH_SLIDER_SCALING_ENABLED is defined, the scaled interpolated position is calculated:
* @f[ Scaled Interpolated Press Position = \frac{InterpolatedPressPosition}{n} @f]
*
* In the equation, n is the most pressed sensor index.
* @image html sliderOutput.jpg "Slider Output Values"
*
* @section featSlider-Config Slider/Wheel Configuration
* <ol>
* <li> Configure the slider/wheel sensors to be scanned as normal sensors in the mTouch_config.h file. Make sure
*      every parameter is set appropriately, so that it can detect a normal touch. See the main configuration
*      guide for more information on this step.
* <li> Open the mTouch_config_slider.h file
*       <ol type="a">
*       <li>Set #MTOUCH_NUMBER_OF_SLIDERS to the total number of sliders/wheels you want to implement.
*       <li>Set #MTOUCH_SLIDER_STEP_SIZE. A small step size will smooth your slider result but will limit
*           its speed and response time. The default value (10) will generally give good results.
*       <li>Enable (recommended) or disable MTOUCH_SLIDER_SCALING_ENABLED based on your needs. If scaling
*           is enabled, the output value will always fall between 0 and 255. If it is disabled, the
*           maximum output value will be dependant on the InterpolatedPressPosition equation shown above.
*       <li>Configure each individual slider/wheel:
*           <ul>
*           <li>For each slider, set MTOUCH_NUMBER_SLIDERx_SENSORS to the number of sensors that will be 
*               used to implement this particularly slider/wheel. (Where 'x' is the slider index.)
*               
*               Example: 
*               @code 
* #define MTOUCH_NUMBER_SLIDER0_SENSORS  4
*               @endcode
*               Slider0 consists of 4 mTouch sensors
*
*           <li>For each sensor of each slider, set MTOUCH_SLIDERx_SENSORy to the MTOUCH_SENSOR index. 
*               (Where 'x' is the slider index and 'y' is the sensor index for that slider.) 
*               
*               Example: 
*               @code 
* #define MTOUCH_SLIDER0_SENSOR1  3
*               @endcode
*               Slider0's second sensor is MTOUCH_SENSOR3
*
*           <li>Define MTOUCH_SLIDERx_WHEEL_ENABLE if the slider is implemented as a wheel on the PCB.
*               This will have it connect the first and last sensors of the slider in the decoding math,
*               as well as implementing a speed and direction indication for use by the application.
*
*           </ul>
*       </ol>
* </ol>
*
* <b>LIMITATION:</b> The framework is not currently able to implement both wheels and sliders in the same
*                    application. The framework is not currently able to support more than one wheel.
*                    So, the framework is able to support up to 10 sliders with 8 sensors per slider 
*                    <b>OR</b> one wheel.
*

*
* @section featSlider-Out Slider/Wheel Output
* The framework provides one output for sliders (position) and three outputs for wheels (position, speed, direction).
* <ul>
* <li>  The slider/wheel position output is stored in the mTouch_slider array.
* <li>  The wheel's extra outputs are stored in a struct called wheelStatus. It contains speed in wheelStatus.speed and direction in 
*       wheelStatus.direction.
*   <ul>
*   <li>The speed range is from 0 to 31, with 0 being no movement and 31 being the fastest.
*   <li>The direction has three states: 0x00 for no-scrolling, 0x01 for scrolling in the positive index direction, 0x02 for scrolling 
*       in the negative index direction.
*   </ul>
* </ul>
*
* @section featSlider-API Slider/Wheel API
* The API for handling the slider and wheel outputs are:
* <ul>
* <li>mTouch_GetSlider(i)   :: returns the value of slider/wheel i
* <li>wheelStatus.direction :: stores the current direction of the wheel
* <li>wheelStatus.speed     :: stores the current speed of the wheel
* </ul>

* @section featSlider-FAQ Frequently Asked Questions
* <ul>
* <li>  <b>Is it possible to make a slider using only one sensor? It could be a single long triangle that gets
*          thinner/thicker as the finger moves along it.</b><br><br>
*       No. 
*       <ul>
*       <li>With only one sensor, there is no way to distinguish between a finger moving side-to-side on the
*           slider and a finger moving up-and-down over the largest part of the slider. The shift magnitude in
*           both cases will change from 0 to 255.
*       <li>If the slider's current value is 255 (max) and the user presses on position 0 of the slider (the

*           will be minimal, so the shift will be close to 0. With a 2-channel slider, the shifts on the two
*           sensors will be opposites. So we won't see a shift on the first sensor, but the second one will
*           have a large shift.

*           slider know that the user is going up instead of side-to-side? With a 2-channel slider, we compare
*           the relationship between the two sensors to see if their ratio changes. Up-down press directions
*           cause only small changes in the ratio while side-to-side directions cause large changes in the

*       <li>The only output value of a sensor is its magnitude, but the maximum magnitude will depend on the
*           user of the application. A middle-aged man with large hands will cause a larger maximum shift than 
*           a 50 lb child. So the ratio between two sensors must be used to eliminate this difference.

/**
* @page featProximity Proximity Sensors
*
* The mTouch Framework supports proximity detection sensors. Enabling this feature for a sensor will provide a
* higher signal-to-noise ratio by applying a median filter. Future updates may further enhance this capability.
* The API for handling the proximity sensor is exactly the same as with a normal sensor.
*
* @section featProx-How How It Works
* The theory of operation for proximity sensors is the same as touch buttons and keys. However, proximity
* sensors must be able to detect very small changes in capacitance, so a median filter is implemented to
* reduce the noise level. The largest cost of implementing this feature is the RAM requirement since we must 
* store the previous N samples for the median filter. This also means the response time will be longer than
* for a normal sensor while the median filter updates.
*
* The basic idea of a median filter is that it stores a history of the previous scan results in a first-in,
* first-out buffer. After each new scan, the oldest value is replaced with the newest, the array is sorted
* by size, and the middle values are averaged.
*
* @image html medianFilter.jpg "Median Filter Illustration"
*
* @section featProx-Config Proximity Sensor Configuration
* <ol>
* <li> Configure the proximity sensor(s) to be scanned as normal sensors in the mTouch_config.h file. The 
*      differences are that you may need to set a larger oversampling value and a lower threshold value to
*      make the sensor more sensitive. The threshold, unlike for button sensors, should not be set by
*      evaluating the maximum touch shift. Instead, set it by observing the maximum noise level. Using the
*      two-way communications with the mTouch Two-Way GUI is an easy way to adjust these values.<br>
*      You can find the mTouch Two-Way GUI in <tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/Utilities/PIC12F PIC16F Utilities/mTouch Two-Way GUI</tt>
* <li> At the bottom of mTouch_config.h is the 'Proximity' configuration section.
*   <ol type="a">
*   <li>Set #MTOUCH_NUMBER_PROXIMITY to the total number of proximity sensors in your system.
*   <li>Define one MTOUCH_SENSORx_IS_PROX definition per enabled proximity sensor. The value of the definition
*       must be its 'proximity index' value. The 'Proximity index' is used as the index to proximity variable
*       arrays. In total, the indexes should start at 0 and end with MTOUCH_NUMBER_PROXIMITY - 1. The order is
*       arbitrary.
* @code
*   #define MTOUCH_NUMBER_PROXIMITY     1          
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR3_IS_PROX      0   // MTOUCH_SENSOR3 is a proximity sensor with index 0   
* @endcode
* @code
*   #define MTOUCH_NUMBER_PROXIMITY     2

*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR9_IS_PROX      1   // MTOUCH_SENSOR9 is a proximity sensor with index 1
* @endcode
*   <li> Set the parameters for the median filter:
*       <ul>
*       <li>#MTOUCH_PROX_BUFFER_SIZE decides the size of the buffer for the median filter. Each proximity
*           sensor will have its own median filter array, so be careful when assigning this value as it will
*           have significant effects on the RAM requirements of the proximity implementation. Valid options
*           are 5, 9, and 15. Larger number means more filtering, but higher RAM requirements and slower
*           response times.
*       <li>#MTOUCH_PROX_REMOVE_EXTREME determines how many of the largest and smallest numbers will be
*           removed before averaging the middle values. For example, if we are filtering with a buffer size
*           of 5 and this value is set to 1, we will average the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th values. With a buffer size
*           of 9 and this value set to 2, we will average the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th values. This value
*           must be less than half the buffer size and greater than 0.
*       <li>Enable (recommended) or disable the #MTOUCH_PROX_USE_32BIT_ACCUM option based on your proximity
*           sensor's output data. Enabling this will prevent math overflow errors when the buffer is being
*           accumulated, but will add to the overall RAM requirement. It's possible you will not need this
*           protection, depending on the configuration, so this has been provided to easily allow toggling
*           between the two. (Example when you don't need the accumulator: buffer size of '5' and remove
*           extreme value of '2'. No accumulation occurs: the middle value is taken as-is.)
*       </ul>

/**
* @page featGuard Guard Ring / Shield

*
* @note One guard ring can be shared among all sensors.
*
* @section featGuard-How How It Works
* Guard rings (or shields) are driven by an I/O or the DACOUT pin to minimize the amount of 
* parasitic capacitance on the sensor. Parasitic capacitance will cause the field lines of the

* driven so that increased coupling (between the mutual drive and the sensor) will cause a shift in the same 
* direction as adding capacitance to the sensor. Both the CVD scan and the mutual drive will be occuring at 
* the same time. This means you are getting the benefit of both scans in one. As the distance between the 
* object-to-be-detected and the sensor gets smaller, the impact of the mutual scan will increase. As the 
* distance gets larger, the self-capacitance mTouch scan will provide a majority of the sensitivity.

/**
* @page featMode Scanning Modes
* Scanning modes allow for an easy way to configure different states for the application where
* different sensors can be scanned in each state. For example, you could have a 'sleep' mode
* scanning a single proximity sensor and an 'active' mode that scans all sensors. You could 
* then alternate between the states based on recent user activity to reduce power consumption.
*
* When switching modes, the first scan result is ignored to allow the filters to properly
* reset themselves. The mTouch_state.skippedDecode bit will be set if this occured with
* the most recent decode and should be used to limit when mode changes can occur. An example
* is provided below.
*
* @section featMode-How How It Works
* All mTouch sensors, regardless of which mode they are in, are first defined as a normal
* mTouch sensor in the mTouch_config.h file. The MTOUCH_SENSORx index value for the sensor
* will be used to configure the modes. 
* 
* The MTOUCH_SENSORx index value will be referred to as the "sensor index".
*
* You can define up to 10 different modes. Each mode must have at least one sensor being scanned.
* (If you wish to simply disable scanning, use the mTouch_DisableScanning() macro.) The framework
* will start in Mode0. All decisions on when to change modes and why are left to the application.
* To change a mode, use the mTouch_ChangeMode(i) call, where i is the mode number. 
*
* The framework will only scan and decode the sensors that are enabled for the currently-active
* mode.

/**
* @page featBasic Basic mTouch Sensor Configuration
* The mTouch Framework scans all sensors in the same basic manner. All sensors (whether normal 'button', part
* of a slider or wheel, a single row in a matrix, or a proximity sensor) start by being scanned using the
* mTouch CVD waveform. Once all enabled sensors have a 'final' reading, the data ready flag is set and the
* decoding routine is called from the main loop.
*
* @section featBasic-Config Basic mTouch Sensor Configuration
* <ol>
* <li>In the mTouch_config.h file, under 'System Setup' start by defining #_XTAL_FREQ to the 
*     frequency of your processor's oscillator in Hz. This does not set the value of your 
*     oscillator - it merely tells the framework what the value is initialized to by your 
*     application.
* <li>Set #MTOUCH_INTEGRATION_TYPE to the behavior you desire for your application.
*   <ul>
*   <li>#MTOUCH_CONTROLS_ISR :: means the framework is the only interrupt in the application
*   <li>#MTOUCH_CALLED_FROM_ISR :: means the application will be calling mTouch_Scan() from its own ISR.
*   <li>#MTOUCH_CALLED_FROM_MAINLOOP :: means the framework will perform scans any time the data-ready flag is checked.
*   </ul>
* <li>Set #MTOUCH_SCAN_FUNCTIONALITY to the behavior you desire for your application.
*   <ul>
*   <li>#MTOUCH_SCANS_ONE_SENSOR :: means the framework only scans a single sensor per mTouch_Scan() call.
*       <ul>
*       <li>This is the preferred value. It provides the best noise immunity due to increased jittering. 
*       </ul>
*   <li>#MTOUCH_SCANS_ALL_SENSORS :: means the framework scans all sensors one time per mTouch_Scan() call.
*       <ul>
*       <li>This can be chosen to increase the sampling rate of the system. Trade-off: slightly decreased noise robustness
*       </ul>
*   </ul>
* <li>Under 'Sensor Setup', set #MTOUCH_NUMBER_SENSORS to the number of sensors to scan, in total.
* @note Each sensor is usually a unique analog channel, but this is not required. To minimize 
*       the possibility of errors in the mTouch waveform, try not to repeat the same analog 
*       channel twice in a row. Also try and avoid having the first and last sensor as the same 
*       analog channel.
* <li>For each sensor:
*   <ol type="a">
*   <li>Set MTOUCH_SENSORx to its corresponding analog channel.
* @code
* #define MTOUCH_SENSOR0                AN0     // Sensor0 is connected to AN4
* @endcode
*   <li>Set THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSORx to the threshold value for this sensor.
* @code
* #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR0       100     // Reading must be 100 counts > the baseline
* @endcode
* @note This value is difficult to determine prior to running the system on the hardware and 
*       examining the level of sensitivity. 100-500 is a good default value but may need to be 
*       drastically adjusted based on the specific hardware design.
*   </ol>
* <li>Under 'Filtering', set #MTOUCH_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN to the amount of oversampling to perform on each sensor.
* <li>Under 'Decoding', set #MTOUCH_BUTTON_TIMEOUT to the maximum number of consecutive 'pressed' state 
*     decisions in a row. After this counter is exceeded, the pressed sensor will be reset to unpressed. 
*     This creates a maximum press time and is an easy way to automatically recover from a stuck sensor.
* <li>Set #MTOUCH_DEBOUNCE_PRESS and #MTOUCH_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE to the amount of debouncing to implement.

/**
* @page GettingStarted Getting Started
*
* @section Expect What to Expect from the mTouch Framework
* When designing with the mTouch Framework, it's important to understand the system's overall behavior. Borrowing
* from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">Wikipedia article</a> on software frameworks, here
* are the distinguishing features of a framework over a library or normal application:<br>
* @li <b>Inversion of Control</b><br><i>In a framework, unlike in libraries or normal user applications, the overall program's
*                                   flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.</i><br>
*                                   The mTouch Framework requires the TMR0 interrupt, ADC, and a significant portion
*                                   of the overall processing time. Developers do, however, have full control over the
*                                   main loop of their application.<br>
*                                   (<b>See also:</b> @ref ResourceRequirements "Resource Requirements")<br><br>
* @li <b>Default Behavior</b><br><i>A framework has default behavior. This default behavior must actually be some useful behavior and not a series of no-ops.</i><br>
*                                   The mTouch Framework's default behavior is to perform a differential CVD scan on the sensors, perform digital
*                                   filtering on the acquired signal, and decode the signal's behavior into a Yes/No press state.<br><br>
* @li <b>Extensibility</b><br><i>A framework can be extended by the user usually by selective overriding or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.</i><br>
*                                   The mTouch Framework comes with a predefined mTouch_Service() function which will perform all of the decoding
*                                   necessary for normal mTouch capacitive buttons. For enhanced capabilities such as sliders, wheels, proximity sensors,
*                                   level sensors, and other capacitive touch uses a custom service function may be required. This simple process is explained

/**
* @page ts-Sensitivity Increasing Sensitivity - Optimizing Performance
*
* @li <b>1. Make sure your application's CVD waveform is correct.</b><br><br>
*        See the @ref ts-Waveform "Waveform Optimization guide" for help with this process. 
* 
* <br>
*
* @li <b>2. Use #MTOUCH_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN to increase the amount of oversampling.</b><br><br>
*        All applications will want to oversample at least 8 times to ensure random noise cannot
*        significantly affect the sensor's reading.<br>
*        <br>
*        Most applications oversample between 30-50 times.<br>
*        <br>
*        The diminishing returns on sensitivity when increasing this value occur at an exponential 
*        rate. This means there is only a small difference at 70 and 80 samples, while there is a 
*        very large difference between 10 and 20 samples. 
* 
* <br>
*
* @li <b>3. Change #MTOUCH_SCALING to 1 to eliminate resolution loss.</b><br><br>
*        When the acquisition module has oversampled #MTOUCH_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN number of times, the final
*        sum must be moved from a 24-bit array to a 16-bit array. The reading value cannot be allowed
*        to exceed the 16-bit limit of 65535. To prevent this from occuring, the framework will use
*        #MTOUCH_SCALING to determine what to divide the accumulation register by. This results in a
*        slight loss in resolution. If this is a concern for your application, setting #MTOUCH_SCALING value to
*        1 will eliminate this step.<br>
*        <br>
*        It is your responsibility to ensure the CVD's reading cannot exceed 65535.
* 
* <br>
*
* @li <b>4. Check that the baseline is not becoming corrupted.</b><br><br>
*        If your baseline is updating too quickly, you may be losing some sensitivity because the baseline
*        is no longer equal to the sensor's unpressed value. To check this, uncomment #MTOUCH_COMM_ASCII_BASELINE
*        in the configuration file and view the baseline in real time with the reading.<br>
*        <br>
*        If the baseline is updating too quickly, you can slow it down by increasing the value of 
*        #MTOUCH_BASELINE_WEIGHT and #MTOUCH_BASELINE_RATE.<br>
*        <br>
*        If the baseline is becoming corrupted due to fast tapping on the sensor, use the 
*        #MTOUCH_NEGATIVE_CAPACITANCE configuration option to adjust how the baseline behaves when the reading
*        has fallen below the baseline. For fast-tapping systems, setting this value to 1 is recommended.
*        Using the '2' value for this option is only recommended for systems that are not going to have
*        any noise spikes.
* 
* <br>
*
* @li <b>5. Decrease the amount of parasitic capacitance affecting the sensor and its trace.</b><br><br>
*        The amount of parasitic capacitance on the sensor will directly impact its maximum level of
*        sensitivity. Eliminate ground planes near your sensor and make sure its trace path is not 
*        running near any high-current or digital lines. This is particularly important for proximity
*        sensors and normal touch sensors with long traces.

/**
* @page ts-ResponseTime Faster Response Time - Optimizing Performance
*
* The response time of your system is going to be determined by the equation:
* @code
* Response Time = mTouch ISR Interrupt Rate * MTOUCH_NUMBER_SENSORS * MTOUCH_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN * MTOUCH_DEBOUNCE_PRESS
* @endcode
*
* <br>
*
* <b>Suggestions for Making the Response Time Faster:</b><br>
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>1. Decrease #MTOUCH_SAMPLES_PER_SCAN to reduce the amount of oversampling.</b><br><br>
*        This configuration option should never drop below 10 in normal applications. The higher 
*        this value is, the more stable the sensor's readings will be coming out of the acquisition
*        ISR. However - the diminishing returns on this value follow an exponential curve. In other
*        words, the increase in signal fidelity when changing from 10 to 20 samples is about the
*        same as changing from 40 to 80.
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>2. Reduce the TMR0 Prescaler value.</b><br><br>
*        This will increase the rate at which the timer's counter will increment. Do not set this
*        value to 1:1 or the interrupt will occur too quickly to allow processing in the main loop.
*        This value is determined by the application when it initializes the OPTION register. The
*        framework does not adjust this register.
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>3. Increase the PIC's oscillator frequency.</b><br><br>
*        This will increase the rate at which the timer's counter will increment, but will also 
*        increase the amount of power needed by the PIC.
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>4. Decrease #MTOUCH_NUMBER_SENSORS.</b><br><br>
*        The mTouch Framework scans all sensors completely before returning the result to be processed
*        by the main loop application. Reducing the number of sensors being scanned will reduce the
*        number of times the ISR must be called before new data is available.
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>5. Reduce the amount of debouncing required to change sensor states.</b><br><br>
*        There are two debounce values available:<br>
*        #MTOUCH_DEBOUNCE_PRESS is for the RELEASE-to-PRESS transition.<br>
*        #MTOUCH_DEBOUNCE_RELEASE is for the PRESS-to-RELEASE transition.

* @section mTouch CVD Waveform Delays
*
* Below is a picture of what the CVD waveform should look like on a scope. Note that sensor lines are
* used both for scanning themselves and the other sensors. You may notice the sensor being pulled high
* and low during other sensor's scans.
*
* @image html cvdWaveform.jpg
*
* The mTouch framework provides the ability to tune the timing of CVD waveform for specific hardware
* designs. The amount of parasitic capacitance, the size of the sensor, the size of the sensor's series
* resistor, and V<sub>DD</sub> all play a role in determining the amount of time required to charge/discharge
* during each step of the scan.
*
* @image html cvdWaveformDelay.jpg "CVD Waveform Delay Configuration Options"
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>CVD_CHOLD_CHARGE_DELAY</b><br><br>
* This value determines the amount of time provided for charging the internal hold capacitor of the
* ADC. <br><br>
* If this value is <b>too small</b>: There will be noticable crosstalk between closely-indexed sensors
* that is not related to the hardware layout of the application.<br>
* If this value is <b>too large</b>: The mTouch ISR will take an unnecessarily long amount of time to 
* execute.<br><br>
* <b>To correctly set this value:</b>
* <ol>
* <li>Set this value to 0, compile and program.
* <li>Look at the raw values on the mTouch One-Way GUI or through a terminal program.<br>
*     You can find the mTouch One-Way GUI in <tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/Utilities/PIC12F PIC16F Utilities/mTouch One-Way GUI</tt>
* <li>Produce the largest shift possible on the sensor with the highest amount of capacitance by pressing
* on it. ("Highest Capacitance" usually corresponds to the sensor with the highest unpressed raw value.)
* <ul>
* <li>Do you notice a strange crosstalk behavior on a different sensor? If no, leave this value to 0. If yes...
* </ul>
* <li>Increase the delay until the crosstalk behavior is eliminated. 
* </ol>
* <br>
* Once you've solved the crosstalk for the sensor with the highest amount of capacitance, the others will 
* be fine as well and you have correctly tuned the Chold delay time.
*
* <br>
*
* @li <b>CVD_SETTLING_DELAY</b><br><br>
* This value determines the amount of time provided for the external sensor and internal hold capacitor
* to charge-average their voltages.<br><br>
* If this value is <b>too small</b>: The sensors will not be as sensitive as they could be and your sensor's readings will be V<sub>DD</sub> dependant.<br>
* If this value is <b>too large</b>: The noise immunity of the system will not be as robust as it could be.<br><br>
* <b>To correctly set this value:</b>
* <ol>
* <li>Set this value to 0, compile and program.
* <li>Look at the raw values on the mTouch One-Way GUI or through a terminal program while powering the system at the desired V<sub>DD</sub> level.<br>
*     You can find the mTouch One-Way GUI in <tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/Utilities/PIC12F PIC16F Utilities/mTouch One-Way GUI</tt>
* <li>Adjust V<sub>DD</sub> by plus and minus 0.5V 
* <ul>
* <li>Do you notice any change in the unpressed value as V<sub>DD</sub> is changing? If no, leave this value alone. If yes...
* </ul>
* <li>Increase the delay until the sensor's reading no longer changes as V<sub>DD</sub> changes.
* </ol>
* <br>
* Once this has occurred, the settling time has been correctly tuned to provide the maximum amount of sensitivity
* while minimizing the framework's susceptibility to noise.

/**
* @page PKSARS232 Loading new firmware on the PICKit Serial Analyzer
*
* @section Intro Introduction
*   The PICKit Serial Analyzer (PKSA) is an easy way to connect the UART of your PIC&reg; microcontroller to your PC. 
*   All of the required steps are handled by the PICKit Serial Loader Utility provided with the framework in the
*   'Utilities' folder of the demos.
*
*   <tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/Utilities/PIC12F PIC16F Utilities/PICKit Serial Loader</tt>
*
*   There are two different ways the PKSA can be used:
*   @li <b>UART-to-USB converter</b> :: UART_USB_PICKitSerial_V1.40.hex :: PKSA behaves as a COM port when connected to the PC.
*   @li <b>Default PKSA Behavior</b> :: PKS-0307-WITHBOOT-0103.HEX :: PKSA behaves as an HID device that is manipulated through a DLL.
*
*   An update to the default PKSA hex file is provided to add support for the RS-232 'break' character. This is required
*   for communicating with the mTouch two-way GUI.
*
* @section Convert Changing the PICKit Serial Analyzer's Hex File
*   <ol>
*   <li>Press the button on the PICKit Serial Analyzer when connecting to PC's USB to enter <tt>Bootloader Mode</tt>.<br>
*     (The 'Target' and 'Busy' LEDs should be flashing quickly.)
*   <li>Open the PICKit Serial Loader Utility provided by the framework in the Utilities folder of the demos.
*   <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to load the new hex file. Hex files and drivers are provided in the same folder 
*       as the loader utility. Make sure to select correct hex file depending on the desired behavior (UART-to-USB COM 
*       port / Updated Default PKSA).
*   </ol>
*
* @section Use Using your PICKit Serial as a UART-to-USB Converter
*   <ol>
*   <li>Unplug and replug the PKSA. Press and hold the black PKSA button to toggle the on-board 5V power supply.
*       <ul>
*       <li>Warning: There is no protection provided on this power supply. Maximum current is 20mA.
*       </ul>
*   <li>LED Status Legend:
*       <ul>
*       <li>Target LED On: Transmission in progress
*       <li>Busy LED On: Reception was successful
*       </ul>
*   </ol>
*
* @section UseNormal Using your PICKit Serial with the default PKSA firmware
*   <ol>
*   <li>Power your mTouch board and connect the PKSA.
*   <li>Open the mTouch Two-Way GUI. The program will begin communicating or will provide error messages with suggestions for resolve any issues.

/**
* @page GettingStartedEval mTouch CVD Evaluation Kit Quick Start Guide 
*
* @note This guide assumes you are using the mTouch Evaluation kit as your hardware. For 
* details on where to begin when implementing the mTouch framework on a custom hardware
* design, use @ref GettingStartedCustom "this guide".
*
* Congratulations for the purchase of your new mTouch CVD Evaluation Kit.
*
* Although the kit will run right out of the box, this document will walk you through
* the setup process to quickly configure the kit. Should you need any custom configuration,
* this will get you up and running.
*
* The kit comes pre-programmed and set to operate in the configuration listed below. If
* you need to alter any of the parameters, then a new hex file will need to be generated
* and the main board will need to be reprogrammed with the new firmware. MPLAB IDE will
* then be required as well as a compatible C compiler.
*
* @section GSE_LAYOUTS Hardware Layouts / Configurations:
* Each of the board versions listed below has a matching demo project provided in:
*   <b><tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/PIC16F_CVD_Demos</tt></b>

*
*
* @section GSE_GUI Communicating with the mTouch GUI:
* The demo hex files and projects  for the evaluation boards are preconfigured to work with 
* the mTouch Two-Way GUI out-of-the box. The default PICKit Serial Analyzer firmware will need 
* to be updated to the latest version. The PICKit Serial Loader utility has been provided to make 
* this easy. You can find it here: <tt>Your MLA Directory/mTouchCapDemos/Utilities/PIC12F PIC16F Utilities/PICKit Serial Loader</tt>
*
* You must load the <b>PKS-0307-WITHBOOT-0103.HEX</b> when requested by the loader utility. See 
* @ref PKSARS232 "this guide".
* 
* Once this is done, power the mTouch evaluation board externally (through any source
* other than the PKSA header), connect the PKSA to the board, and start the mTouch GUI.
*
* @section GSE_CNS Changing the Number of Sensors:
* If you need the stack to manage more or less than the default number, all you need to 
* do is update the constant #MTOUCH_NUMBER_SENSORS to any other value from 1 to 15. This
* constant can be found in the mTouch_config.h file.
*
* @section GSE_ASI Assigning Sensor Indexes to the Correct A/D Channels
* Depending on how the daughter board is connected to the main board, the sensors may
* be connected to different A/D inputs on the PIC microcontroller. In the mTouch
* framework, sensors can be mapped to a specific index in the application. Go to
* mTouch_config.h and look for the section with the definitions shown below, and
* map the sensor indexes on the left side to the correct A/D channels for your setup.
* @code
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR0             AN0  
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR1             AN1    
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR2             AN2     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR3             AN3     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR4             AN4     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR5             AN5     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR6             AN6     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR7             AN7     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR8             AN8     
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR9             AN9

*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR11            AN11    
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR12            AN12    
*   #define MTOUCH_SENSOR13            AN13
* @endcode
*
* @section GSE_CAC Changing the Number of Samples per Scan
* The number of samples taken in an application will be based on a trade-off between
* sensitivity and response time. The more samples taken, the better the signal-to-noise
* ratio of the system, but the slower its response to a finger. Typical response times
* are less than 100ms to eliminate delay that is visible to the human eye. If a specific
* response time is required, example equations are provided in the configuration file
* to show how to calculate the rate that will be chosen based on this value.
*
* @section GSE_AST Adjusting the Sensor Threshold Values
* Your mTouch evaluation kit comes already preconfigured with the sensor threshold
* values for the 8-button daughter board. If different sensitivities are needed, go
* to the mTouch_config.h file, locate the section with the definitions shown
* below, and set the new values.
* A general rule of thumb to finding and setting correct values is to determine the
* range of shift for the sensor (min and max shift) and set the threshold to about
* 75% of the range. The following formula can be used: 
* @f[ Threshold_{Press} = min + 0.75 (max - min) @f]
* @code
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR0         65         
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR1         65
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR2         65
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR3         65
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR4         65
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR5         65
*   #define THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR6         65
* @endcode
*
* @section Framework Configuration and Application API Hooks

/**
* @defgroup Acquisition Acquisition
* @brief Generates and executes a configured version of the CVD acquisition routine
*
* The mTouch Acquisition module generates an assembly implementation of the interrupt
* service routine that is designed to maximize noise immunity and minimize execution
* time. It will automatically add and remove macros as the number of sensors in the
* application changes. By default, it will use the previously scanned sensor as the
* reference for the current scan. If the application only has a single sensor, a special
* acquisition method which does not require a reference sensor is used. This specialized
* method should not be used in systems with more than one sensor due to crosstalk
* concerns.
*/
/**
* @defgroup Decoding Filtering and Decoding
*
* The mTouch Filtering and Decoding module executes the detection algorithms for the
* framework. Using the latched output from the acquisition module, the service function
* is called each time a new value is available for each sensor. It will then loop
* through all of the active sensors and determine if they have changed state.
*
* This is achieved by implementing a baseline average of the sensor's reading. The
* baseline is only updated while the sensor is in the #MTOUCH_RELEASED state. The difference
* between the baseline and the current reading is compared against the #THRESHOLD_PRESS_SENSOR0
* (or equivalent) value to determine if a change in state is necessary.
*
* If the system sees that the reading has dipped below the baseline - the opposite direction
* of a finger press - the baseline will update itself based on the behavior chosen by
* configuration option #MTOUCH_NEGATIVE_CAPACITANCE.
