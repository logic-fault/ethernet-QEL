The crypto files distributed with the Microchip Application Libraries do not contain any crypto implementation. They are just place holder files that are included with certain MPLAB projects. When compiled or linked they would produce an error with the instructions to obtain the files that contain the actual crypto implementation. The real crypto files are distributed via the software package SW300052, available from www.microchipdirect.com.
